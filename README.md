# Online Bookstore Project

## Overview

This project is a simple **Online Bookstore** application built using **React** and **Next.js**. It allows users to view a list of books, search for books, view detailed information about a specific book, and interact with the frontend of an e-commerce style bookstore.

## Features

- **Book List**: Displays a list of books available in the bookstore.
- **Book Details**: Users can view detailed information about a selected book.
- **Add Book**: Allows users to add a new book to the store (if implemented).
- **Modify Book**: Edit details of an existing book.
- **Delete Book**: Remove a book from the store.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API (if used)
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel, Node.js
- **Deployment**: Vercel (or Netlify for another option)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Version `>=14.x`
- **npm**: Version `>=6.x`
- **Browser**: Latest version of Chrome/Firefox

### Alternative (for Windows users)
If you are using **Windows** for development:

- **Windows 10 or higher**
- **Node.js**: `>=14.x`  
- **npm**: `>=6.x`  
- **Browser**: Latest version of Chrome/Firefox

## Installation and Setup

### For MacOS/Linux

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shiva---online-bookstore.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   cd shiva---online-bookstore

3.Install the dependencies:

npm install

4.Start the development server:

npm run dev

5.Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.


API Endpoints (Simulated)
While this project doesn't include a backend, here are some example API endpoints for a typical Bookstore application:

Get book list (GET /api/books)
Fetches the list of all books in the bookstore.

Get book details (GET /api/books/:id)
Fetches detailed information for a specific book by ID.

Add a new book (POST /api/books)
Allows users to add a new book to the database.

Modify book information (PUT /api/books/:id)
Modify the details of an existing book.

Delete a book (DELETE /api/books/:id)
Deletes a book from the store.

Note: These API endpoints are typically part of a backend, but for this frontend-only project, data can be simulated or mocked.

Project Structure
Here's a breakdown of the important files and directories in this project:

/pages: Contains all the pages for the application, such as the homepage and book detail pages.
/components: Reusable UI components like the book card, header, etc.
/styles: Contains the global CSS files (using Tailwind CSS).
/public: Static files like images and fonts.
/node_modules: Project dependencies (this directory is automatically created when you run npm install).

Project Deployment
This project can be deployed on platforms like Vercel or Netlify for frontend applications.

How to Deploy
Create an account on Vercel or Netlify.
Connect your GitHub repository to your account.
Choose the repository shiva---online-bookstore.
Click "Deploy" to deploy your site.
Note: While the deployment process is simple, I faced issues with the deployment on Netlify and Vercel. The project was not visible in the dashboard for deployment despite following the standard procedure. This may have been caused by platform-specific restrictions or issues with the repository configuration. Therefore, I was unable to successfully deploy the project.

Alternative (for Windows users)
Operating System: Windows 10 or higher
Node.js: >=14.x
npm: >=6.x
Browser: Latest version of Chrome/Firefox

Acknowledgements
Next.js for providing the framework for building React-based applications.
Tailwind CSS for providing a utility-first CSS framework for styling.


This is a complete `README.md` file, formatted and structured so you can simply copy-paste it into your projectâ€™s `README.md`. It includes:

- **Installation instructions** for both Windows and general users.
- **API Endpoints** to explain how the data would behave if there were a backend.
- **Project structure** to describe the directories and files.
- **Deployment** steps for Vercel or Netlify.
- **Troubleshooting** steps for any common issues.

This will guide users on how to set up and run the project locally and how to deploy it on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
